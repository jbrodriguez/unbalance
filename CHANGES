Version 1.8.0 - 2016-11-11
- Add messages when permission issues arise Related to #11
- Fix syntax style Related to #11
- Restrict when to send the perm issues message If bytestomove == 0, no action will take place anyway, so there's no point in sending the perm issue msg Also check that we actually have issues Related to #11
- Display the warning when perm issues are found Related to #11
- Ignore binaries
- Fix errors Related to #11
- Use alternate method to get uid/gid Turns out os.User is based on cgo, so it can't be cross-compiled and is currently missing from linux/amd64 Roll out your own Related to #11

By having a timeout state, the last event wins: it grabs the timeout state, if there's any it clears it and sets it's own. Related to #11
- First pass at logic to decide whether we need to issue a warning We still need to make sure it works against the new permissions script Related to #11
- Fix logic to detect issues Logic checks for Folders rwxrwxrwx Files rw-rw-rw- or r--r--r--

    back: Update the rsync flags to new default ("-avRX --partial"), if currently set to the old default ("-avX --partial")
    back: If the rsync flags include -R, then set src to relative and dst to just the root path. Otherwise, set both to full absolute paths.
    app: Set tests for new features
    app: Test for default flags
    app: Bump version


Version 1.5.3 - 2016-06-08
    back: Fix working directory argument position
    back: Double check anyway, set the working dir only if specified in the argument
    app: Bump version


Version 1.5.2 - 2016-06-08

    Release 1.4.0


Version 1.3.7 - 2016-03-03
    - Show only the main cache disk
    Release 1.3.7


Version 1.3.6 - 2016-03-02
    - Upgrade mlog (with lowered maxSize logs)
    - Remove fuser calls since it's generating cannot stat warning that ultimately affect operations. This also removes the size, empty and symlinkclauses. The main reason for these changes is that unbalance should be run as the only data modifying app on the unraid server when it's moving files. Any other scenario, will certainly have unpredictable results. I will eventually discuss with trinapicot/Freddie
    - Add license as per https://github.com/trinapicot/unraid-diskmv/blob/master/LICENSE
    - Redirect stderr to a logging function providing by the calling party

    initial commit
    completed work on refactoring the packer service provider. mapped it to a separate object with better functionality separation. will now work on refactor the concept itself, adding an option to let the code work against all disks. so i will iterate over disks in desc order of freespace, run a bestfit on it, pick the first solution, simulate a decrease of space on the disk, repeat, rinse
    not working commit, have to change everything to references instead of copy, doesnt work that way
    prototyped a removeFolder function based off stackoverflow, need to test against the real thing (currently mocking in osx)
    first working version, need to sort disks by free space (desc)
    preparing to replace ui
    static ui prototype
    ignore unbalance binary
    really ignore unbalance binary
    first steps for frontend ui, now will work on backed websocket server
    base websocket functionality in backend, so i will now merge both features and work on integration from here on
    * feature/ui:
      first steps for frontend ui, now will work on backed websocket server
    first stage of integration is completed, messages to the server are working, so now i'll work on a reply to the frontend, to close the integration feature
    communicatio between both parties is working, now need to complete proof of concept for gui, adding models and such to make angular actually render a dynamic ui
    first version with basic functionality going for it ... way to go !!
    + include only healthy disks in output (DISK_OK)
    + correct json tags for box object
    + rearrange ui columns and data (changing both html and js code)
    + added a replace filter (to remove '/mnt/' from output)
    showing which disks would be changed as part of the best fit scenario
    still work in progress and unstable, but will get to here today, will continue later
    had to move messages into lib, to prevent import cycle not allowed error , but i'm coming back with a vengeance to solve this once and for all
    it compiles, which is a good thing ! will work on finally getting that copying functionality home
    testing core move functionality, looks fine so far
    - Implemented a test to reserve some space, beyond which the knapsack algorithm shouldn't go
    - Cleaned up testing code
    - Defined the output of the move to be the commands that would be executed if the move actually took place (think of it as a dry run)
